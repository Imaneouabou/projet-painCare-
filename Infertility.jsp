													Limited research has been conducted on the correlation between endometriosis and fertility. However, there 
													is a prevailing perception that, in general, women with endometriosis might encounter increased challenges when 
													attempting to conceive.
													</p>
													<p>
													Research findings suggest that women diagnosed with minimal to mild endometriosis experience prolonged 
													conception periods and lower likelihood of becoming pregnant compared to the general population. Furthermore, 
													there is an observed correlation indicating that as the severity of endometriosis increases, women are more 
													likely to encounter challenges in achieving pregnancy. Consequently, those with moderate to severe 
													endometriosis tend to face greater difficulty conceiving when compared to their counterparts with minimal
													 to mild endometriosis.
													 </p>
													 <h3>
													 <strong>
													 Endometriosis does not equal infertility!
													 </strong>
													 </h3> <br>
													 <p>
													 It's crucial to emphasize that having endometriosis does not foreclose the possibility of having children. 
													 Instead, it suggests that there may be additional challenges in achieving pregnancy.
													 </p>
													 <p>
													 Numerous women with endometriosis successfully conceive without impediments, while others may experience 
													 delays in conception. Overcoming these challenges may involve interventions such as surgery or assisted 
													 reproductive technologies, and in many cases, persistence and time are key factors in achieving pregnancy.
													 </p>
													 <h3>
													 <strong>
													    Causes
													 </strong>
													 </h3>
													 <p>
													 In most cases, it is not understood why it is harder for women with endometriosis to become pregnant.									
													 The exception to the rule is when the woman’s endometriosis is severe enough to cause damage to one or more of the organs involved in conception. 
													 For example, if the ovaries are covered in thick adhesions, the egg may not be able to escape from the ovary to be fertilised. Similarly,
													 if the ovaries or fallopian tubes are stuck in abnormal places by adhesions, the newly released egg may not be able to ‘find’ the entrance 
													 to the fallopian tube. Such damage is usually found only in some women with moderate or severe endometriosis.
													 Many theories have been proposed to explain why it is harder for women with endometriosis to conceive. However, as yet, none have been proven.
													 It is possible that there are several causes and that different causes are relevant in different women. Some of the theories include:
													 </p>
													 <ul>
														 <li>Pelvic adhesions inhibit the movement of the egg down the fallopian tube</li>
														 <li>Eggs are of poor quality</li>
														 <li>Chemicals produced by the endometriosis inhibit the movement of the egg down the fallopian tube</li>
														 <li>Inflammation in the pelvis caused by endometriosis stimulates the production of cells that attack the sperm and shorten their life span</li>
													     <li>Eggs are not released from the ovaries each month (also known as anovulation, which may also occur in women without endometriosis)</li>
													 </ul>
													<h3>
													<strong>
													 Hormonal treatment
													</strong>
													</h3>
													<h5>Minimal–mild endometriosis</h5>
												
													<p>
													In women with minimal–mild endometriosis, hormonal drugs are not an effective treatment for endometriosis-related infertility,
													as none of the drugs leads to better pregnancy rates. Therefore, they should not be used to improve fertility in women with 
													minimal–mild endometriosis
													</p> <br>
										
													<h5>Moderate–severe endometriosis</h5>
												
													<p>
													In women with more severe disease, no published studies have looked at the effect of hormonal treatment on infertility. 
													However, it is assumed that they are not effective, so they should not be used to improve infertility in women with 
													moderate–severe disease
													</p> <br>
													
													<h3>
													<strong>
													 Surgical treatment
													</strong>
													</h3>
													
													<h4>Aim</h4>
                                                    <p>
                                                    Surgery for endometriosis-related infertility aims to remove any endometriosis and adhesions present. 
                                                    If the endometriosis has damaged any organs, or resulted in them being stuck down in abnormal positions, 
                                                    the surgery will also try to repair the damage and restore the anatomy of the organs to as close as possible 
                                                    to their normal positioning
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>Minimal–Mild Endometriosis</h4>
                                                    <p>
                                                    In women with minimal–mild endometriosis, laparoscopic surgery is an effective treatment for endometriosis-related 
                                                    infertility, as it leads to better pregnancy rates than a diagnostic laparoscopy alone
                                                    </p>

                                                   <h4>Moderate–Severe Endometriosis</h4>
                                                   <p> 
                                                   In women with moderate–severe endometriosis, no well designed studies have looked at the effect 
                                                   of surgery on pregnancy rates.
                                                   </p>

												  <p>
												   However, three studies seem to suggest that the more severe the endometriosis the lower the pregnancy rates
												   following surgery . In other words, it seems that women with severe endometriosis are less likely 
												   to become pregnant following surgery than women with mild or moderate endometriosis.
												  </p>

                                                  <p>
                                                   Nevertheless, some gynaecologists believe that women with the most severe forms of endometriosis have the
                                                   greatest improvements in pregnancy rates following surgery . In other words, surgery seems to increase 
                                                   their chances of becoming pregnant proportionally more than women with less severe endometriosis.
                                                  </p>

                                             <h4>Ovarian Endometriomas</h4>
		                                          <p>
		                                          There is considerable debate about how large ovarian endometriomas in women with endometriosis-related infertility 
		                                          should be treated . The three main treatments are:
		                                          </p>

                                         
											  <ul>
											    <li>&#9733;  Draining the endometrioma</li>
											    <li>&#9733;  Draining and coagulating (burning the lining of) the endometrioma</li>
											    <li>&#9733;  Excising (remove by cutting out) the endometrioma from the ovary</li>
											  </ul><br>

                                              <p>
                                              Several studies indicate that laparoscopically excising large endometriomas greater than 4 cm in diameter leads 
                                              to increased pregnancy rates and decreased recurrence rates compared with draining and coagulating the endometrioma
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                              Removing an ovarian endometrioma allows the diagnosis of endometriosis to be confirmed by a pathologist, may 
                                              reduce pain and discomfort, and may make it easier for the gynaecologist to collect follicles 
                                              (potential eggs) for IVF.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                              However, removing an endometrioma may also result in the removal of some of the adjacent ovarian tissue, 
                                              including some follicles (potential eggs). This may lead to decreased functioning of the ovary and occasionally 
                                              even loss of ovarian function, particularly in women who have had previous ovarian surgeries.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                              Thus, the decision to remove or not remove an endometrioma must be carefully considered in the light of your
                                               circumstances .
                                              </p>
